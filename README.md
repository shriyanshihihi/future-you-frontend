# 💌 Dear Me — A Letter From Your Future Self

**Time travel through words. Reflect today. Receive hope from tomorrow.**

---

## Inspiration

During moments of uncertainty, self-doubt, or pressure, many of us wish we could hear reassurance from a wiser version of ourselves — someone who has already lived through the confusion and come out stronger.

**Dear Me** was inspired by a simple question:

> _What if your future self could write you a letter today?_

This project uses AI not for automation or productivity, but for **reflection, comfort, and emotional clarity**.

1. Reflect on their present struggles, fears, and dreams
